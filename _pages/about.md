***I am actively looking for potential PhD Supervisors. My CV is linked [here](/Users/krishnaiyer/krishna22112023.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).***

Hi there! I am a senior AI researcher at the Artifical Intelligence Data Analytics and Strategic Technolgy Center ([AI.DA STC](https://www.stengg.com/en/digital-tech/data-science-analytics-and-ai)) at ST Engineering, Singapore 

**Research** \
I am interested in research on sequential data (natural language processing and time-series). More specifically on Representation learning, sample-efficient deep learning and Information retrieval. More recently, I am exploring multi-agent LLMs, multi-modal representation learning and mechanistic interpretability.  

**Previously**\
I have worked as a R&D Engineer in the wirebonding division at ASM Pacific Technology, Singapore on time-series representation learning and domain adaptation problems towards [AI of Things (AIoT)](https://semi.asmpt.com/en/news-center/market-insights/realising-the-smart-factory-vision-through-an-ai-of-things-aiot-approach/).\
I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer control and automation from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore where I was advised by Dr. [Muhammad Faeyz Karim](https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/profiles/karim-muhammad-faeyz.html) on health monitoring and diagnosis systems using mmWave radars and deep learning. I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and communications from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore where I researched on evolutionary algorithmic optimization and remote sensing technologies for structural health monitoring.
