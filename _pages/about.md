***I am actively looking for potential PhD Supervisors. My CV is linked [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).***

Hi there! I am a senior AI researcher at the Artifical Intelligence Data Analytics and Strategic Technolgy Center ([AI.DA STC](https://www.stengg.com/en/digital-tech/data-science-analytics-and-ai)) at ST Engineering, Singapore 

**Research** \
My research focuses on:

1. Hardware-Efficient AI/ML for Edge Computing: Neural architecture search (NAS), Knowledge distillation, quantization, Sparse neural networks and neuromorphic spike neural networks towards hardware-aware energy efficient computing
2. Multi-Agent Large Language Models: Ongoing research on building multi-agent VLM frameworks for vision models
3. Information Retrieval: RAG, Representation learning

**Previously**\
I have worked as a R&D Engineer in the wirebonding division at ASM Pacific Technology, Singapore on time-series representation learning and domain adaptation problems towards [AI of Things (AIoT)](https://semi.asmpt.com/en/news-center/market-insights/realising-the-smart-factory-vision-through-an-ai-of-things-aiot-approach/).

**Education**\
I graduated with a Masters degree in Computer control and automation from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore where I was advised by Dr. [Muhammad Faeyz Karim](https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/profiles/karim-muhammad-faeyz.html) on health monitoring and diagnosis systems using mmWave radars and deep learning. I received my bachelor's degree in Electronics and communications from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore where I researched on evolutionary algorithmic optimization and remote sensing technologies for structural health monitoring.
